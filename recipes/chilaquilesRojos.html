        <p>
            Chilaquiles are a mexican typical dish, especially eaten when trying to recover from a hangover or 'cruda' as we call it here in Mexico.
            Chilaquiles are basically fried tortillas bathed in a green or red sauce. Don't let the color deceive you, normally the green sauce is the spicy one.
            You could also add a protein, such as chicken, meat or eggs. Lastly, add cheese, cream and onion on top and you're good to go.
