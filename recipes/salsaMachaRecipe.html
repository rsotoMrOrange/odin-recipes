            The 'Salsa Macha' is a mexican (often) spicy sauce. Throughout the country, you can find different versions of this sauce, the main difference: the chili used.
            Other than that, the recipe or the steps shouldn't change that much. This is a fairly spicy sauce (even for people used to consuming it!) so be
            careful when you give it a try.
